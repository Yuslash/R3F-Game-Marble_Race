### üí° Design Notes

- **Font Selection**: The font used in the project, `Bebas Neue`, is an excellent choice for headers, adding a bold and modern look. For the body text in the README, consider using a clean and professional sans-serif font like `Roboto` or `Open Sans`.
- **Styling Tips**: 
  - Keep the README organized with clear headings and sections.
  - Use markdown features like bold text, code blocks, and bullet points to enhance readability.
  - Consider adding more visual elements, like additional screenshots or a GIF of gameplay, to make the README more engaging.
