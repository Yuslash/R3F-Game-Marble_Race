### Design Notes:

- **Font Selection**: The font used in the project, `Bebas Neue`, is a great choice for headers. For body text in the README, a clean and modern sans-serif font like `Roboto` or `Open Sans` would be suitable.
- **Styling**: Keep the README simple and structured. You can use markdown features like bold, italics, and code blocks for clarity.
